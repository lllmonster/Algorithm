# Conclusion

There are more array-related data structures we need to learn.

1. Other data structures  
  - String
  - Hash table
  - Linked List
  - Queue
  - Stack

2. Understand the principle of some widely-used sorting algorithms and their complexity.

3. Binary search is used to search a specific element in a sorted array.

4. Two pointer also can be used in,
  - Slow-pointer and faster-pointer problem in Linked List
  - Sliding Window Problem

5. Two pointers technique sometimes will relate to Greedy Algorithm which helps us to design our pointers' movement strategy.
